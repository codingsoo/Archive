### 1. Social Engineering Defense

**Summary:** The Social Engineering Defense project is designed to detect scam emails using advanced text analysis techniques. The system integrates multiple open-source tools for email crawling, sentence processing, form item detection, command analysis, and question analysis, making it a robust solution for identifying phishing attempts.

**Achievements:**
- **Presented at BlackHat USA 2018**: [Whitepaper](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Harris-Catch-Me-Yes-We-Can-wp.pdf)  
- **Published in SA 2019**: [IEEE Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8938036)  

**Key Features:**
- **Email Crawling**: Retrieves and processes email data with tools like BeautifulSoup and Langid.
- **Sentence Processing**: Uses Punctuator2 and Punkt for sentence boundary detection and grammar restoration.
- **Form Item Detection**: Converts forms into question formats for analysis.
- **Sentence Type Identification**: Detects commands and questions using Stanford CoreNLP and a POS tagger.
- **Blacklist Verification**: Uses TF-IDF to identify malicious command patterns.
- **Question Scam Detection**: Employs a modified Paralex Question Answering System for scam detection.

### 2. [Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker](sc-vulnerability-checker/)

**Summary:** The Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker was developed to analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts without requiring access to their source code. By combining a custom smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) with a vulnerability analysis server, this tool offered an innovative way to detect and report potential security issues.

**Achievements:**  
- Received the 2018 Korea Computer Congress Best Undergraduate Paper Award.  
- Published paper (in Korean): [Link to DBpia](http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE07503549).

**Key Features:**  
- Utilized a custom ERC20-compatible smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) to interface with users.  
- Allowed users to submit smart contract addresses for analysis.  
- Communicated with an analysis server using `web3.js` to process the bytecode and report results.  

**Architecture:** The project implemented a real-time vulnerability detection workflow using Ethereum smart contracts and external analysis servers.

### 3. [Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot](virtual-girlfriend/)

**Summary:** The Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot is a web application that simulates conversations with an imaginary girlfriend. Users can choose between two personality conceptsâ€”friendly and softy. Through machine learning, the chatbot can read documents and respond in a human-like manner.

**Achievement:** 3rd Prize in OpenHack Korea 2017 [Event Link](https://sigoss.github.io/hackathon2017/index.html).

**Key Features:**  
- Two chatbot concepts: friendly and softy.  
- Machine learning-powered document reading and conversational abilities.  
- Extendable with custom models for improved responses.

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`virtual-girlfriend`](virtual-girlfriend/) directory.
