### 1. [Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker](sc-vulnerability-checker/)

**Summary:**  
The Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker was developed to analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts without requiring access to their source code. By combining a custom smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) with a vulnerability analysis server, this tool offered an innovative way to detect and report potential security issues.

**Achievements:**  
- Received the **2018 Korea Computer Congress Best Undergraduate Paper Award**.  
- Published paper (in Korean): [Link to DBpia](http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE07503549).

**Key Features:**  
- Utilized a custom ERC20-compatible smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) to interface with users.  
- Allowed users to submit smart contract addresses for analysis.  
- Communicated with an analysis server using `web3.js` to process the bytecode and report results.  

**Architecture:**  
The project implemented a real-time vulnerability detection workflow using Ethereum smart contracts and external analysis servers.

### 2. [Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot](virtual-girlfriend/)

**Summary:**  
The Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot is a web application that simulates conversations with an imaginary girlfriend. Users can choose between two personality conceptsâ€”friendly and softy. Through machine learning, the chatbot can read documents and respond in a human-like manner.

**Achievement:** Secured **3rd Prize** in **OpenHack Korea 2017** [Event Link](https://sigoss.github.io/hackathon2017/index.html).

**Key Features:**  
- Two chatbot concepts: friendly and softy.  
- Machine learning-powered document reading and conversational abilities.  
- Extendable with custom models for improved responses.

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`virtual-girlfriend`](virtual-girlfriend/) directory.
