## Archived Projects

### 1. [A Chatbot for Git Conflict Detection and Resolution](conflict-prediction/)

**Summary:** 
A real-time chatbot, Sayme, enhances developer collaboration by detecting, predicting, and resolving Python code conflicts, providing conflict alerts and recommendations via Slack.

**Achievements:** Published at BotSE 2019 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8823615)

**Key Features:**

- Conflict Management: Detects direct and indirect code conflicts, predicts conflict probability, and provides severity details.
- File Controls: Supports ignoring files (like .gitignore), locking files with warnings, and identifying ignored or locked files.
- Collaboration Tools: Shares user working statuses, tracks code history, and sends messages or recommendations for conflict resolution.
- User Interaction: Greets users, provides updates, and allows disabling alarms or conflict notifications.

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`conflict-prediction`](conflict-prediction/) directory. Latest version is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/security-defenders/social-engineering-defense).

### 2. [Social Engineering Defense](social-engineering-defense/)

**Summary:** The Social Engineering Defense project is designed to detect scam emails using advanced text analysis techniques. The system integrates multiple open-source tools for email crawling, sentence processing, form item detection, command analysis, and question analysis, making it a robust solution for identifying phishing attempts.

**Achievements:**
- **Presented at BlackHat USA 2018**: [Whitepaper](https://i.blackhat.com/us-18/Thu-August-9/us-18-Harris-Catch-Me-Yes-We-Can-wp.pdf)  
- **Published in SA 2019**: [IEEE Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8938036)  

**Key Features:**
- **Email Crawling**: Retrieves and processes email data with tools like BeautifulSoup and Langid.
- **Sentence Processing**: Uses Punctuator2 and Punkt for sentence boundary detection and grammar restoration.
- **Form Item Detection**: Converts forms into question formats for analysis.
- **Sentence Type Identification**: Detects commands and questions using Stanford CoreNLP and a POS tagger.
- **Blacklist Verification**: Uses TF-IDF to identify malicious command patterns.
- **Question Scam Detection**: Employs a modified Paralex Question Answering System for scam detection.

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`social-engineering-defense`](social-engineering-defense/) directory. Latest version is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/security-defenders/social-engineering-defense).

### 3. [Evlock](Evlock/)

**Summary:** Evlock is a Klaytn-based peer-to-peer energy trading system that integrates advanced security measures, including ARM TrustZone and TLS, to address 34 identified vulnerabilities in blockchain-based smart grids, ensuring fast, secure, and reliable energy transactions.

**Achievements:**
- This project received 1st award from Line Blockchain Competition!
- News (Korean): https://plus.hankyung.com/apps/newsinside.view?aid=201901287542A&category=AA010&sns=y

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`Evolck`](Evolck/) directory.


### 4. [Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker](sc-vulnerability-checker/)

**Summary:** The Smart Contract Vulnerability Checker was developed to analyze vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts without requiring access to their source code. By combining a custom smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) with a vulnerability analysis server, this tool offered an innovative way to detect and report potential security issues.

**Achievements:**  
- Received the 2018 Korea Computer Congress Best Undergraduate Paper Award.  
- Published paper (in Korean): [Link to DBpia](http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE07503549).

**Key Features:**  
- Utilized a custom ERC20-compatible smart contract (Kookmin Security Token) to interface with users.  
- Allowed users to submit smart contract addresses for analysis.  
- Communicated with an analysis server using `web3.js` to process the bytecode and report results.  

**Architecture:** The project implemented a real-time vulnerability detection workflow using Ethereum smart contracts and external analysis servers.

### 5. [Signal Project](signal/)

**Summary:** Automatically generate sign language videos from input MP4 files. MobileNet and Online Learning algorithms are the key algorithms in this project.

**Achievement:** This project won 3rd place in the Hand-in-Hand Challenge (details: [Testworks Blog](https://blog.testworks.co.kr/sign-language-data-hand-in-hand-challenge-3/)).

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`signal`](signal/) directory.

### 6. [Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot](virtual-girlfriend/)

**Summary:** The Virtual Girlfriend Chatbot is a web application that simulates conversations with an imaginary girlfriend. Users can choose between two personality conceptsâ€”friendly and softy. Through machine learning, the chatbot can read documents and respond in a human-like manner.

**Achievement:** 3rd Prize in OpenHack Korea 2017 [Event Link](https://sigoss.github.io/hackathon2017/index.html).

**Key Features:**  
- Two chatbot concepts: friendly and softy.  
- Machine learning-powered document reading and conversational abilities.  
- Extendable with custom models for improved responses.

**Directory:** All related files for this project can be found in the [`virtual-girlfriend`](virtual-girlfriend/) directory.

### 7. [Openhack-Judge](openhack2019/)

**Summary:** This is a project scoring tool that will be a reference for judges at the 2019 OpenHack (Opensource Hackathon). This tool will evaluate how many people are engaged in the project, how many commit is added, and so on. This project's codes are based on [Hackathoners](https://github.com/harrydrippin/hackathoners).

**Achievement:** Used as a judging tool during the OpenHack 2019 event.
