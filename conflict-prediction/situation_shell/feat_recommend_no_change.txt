You made {severity_gap:.2f}% fewer changes than <@{user2}>. Best to stop editing, and let them know.
You probably should inform <@{user2}> that your changes are {severity_gap:.2f}% smaller than theirs, and maybe pause your work for now.
I feel it would not be a wise choice for you to continue working on this file, but do coordinate with <@{user2}> anyways to see when they are done with their changes.
I recommend you talk to <@{user2}>; you changed {severity_gap:.2f}% less than they did, so maybe you can pause your work for just a bit and let them know.
Your changes are smaller than <@{user2}>â€™s ({user1_severity:.2f}% vs {user2_severity:.2f}%).
