I’d recommend you be careful editing *{filename1}*, since {user2} is editing *{filename2}* and an indirect conflict may arise.
Changing this file may cause an indirect conflict with {user2}, since they are currently editing *{filename2}*.
Best not to work on this file right now because of *{filename2}* editing by {user2}.
You may want to wait until {user2} is done working on *{filename2}*.
I’d recommend you talk with {user2} first, as their changes on *{filename2}* may conflict.
