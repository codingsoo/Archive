Your changes on *{filename}* may cause conflict as <@{user2}> is already working on that file.
Just wanted to tell you that it’s best if you talk with <@{user2}>, since both of you are now working on the same file.
*{filename}* is being modified by <@{user2}> right now. You may want to talk with <@{user2}> before proceeding.
<@{user2}> is currently working on *{filename}*. Please talk to <@{user2}> before editing the file.
Heads up! <@{user2}> is editing *{filename}* and if you continue changing that file, conflicts may happen. Why don’t you talk with <@{user2}> first?
<@{user2}> has started to also work on *{filename}*. You may want to talk to them.
Heads up! <@{user2}> is now also modifying *{filename}*, which may cause conflicts.
Just so you’re aware, <@{user2}> has begun to edit *{filename}*. Probably best to talk to them now before you may make conflicting changes.
I think you should talk to <@{user2}>. They’ve started editing {filename} as well.
<@{user1}>, <@{user2}> is now also editing *{filename}* which leads to having conflicts. Maybe you should talk with them.
