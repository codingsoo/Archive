<@{user2}> is editing *{function1}* in *{filename2}*. If you use that function in *{filename1}*, it may lead to an indirect conflict.
I think it is wise if you postpone making changes involving *{function1}* in *{filename1}*, because <@{user2}> is modifying its definition in *{filename2}* and that could lead to an indirect conflict.
<@{user2}> is currently editing *{function1}* in *{filename2}* and an indirect conflict may occur if you use that function in *{filename1}*.
If you use *{function1}* in *{filename1}* an indirect conflict is likely to arise, since <@{user2}> is currently editing the definition of that function in *{filename2}*.
Your use of *{function1}* in *{filename1}* may lead to a problem since <@{user2}> is making changes to that function right now.
